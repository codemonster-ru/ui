# Changelog

## 1.18.4

### Fixed

- Corrected published declaration paths for the `./foundation` and `./theme` subpath exports.
- Added the missing `./theme.css` package export and covered it in the foundation contract test.
- Ensured bundled component styles include the generated token and theme fallback CSS.

## 1.18.3

### Fixed

- Updated the `vf-prose` inline-code selector to use complex `:not()` notation for stylelint compatibility without changing prose exclusion behavior.

## 1.18.2

### Changed

- Added first-class prose escape support for embedded interactive components:
  - introduced official `.vf-prose-exclude` escape class for prose containers
  - excluded `.vf-playground` and `.vf-codeblock` descendants from `vf-prose` typography selectors out of the box
  - preserved prose vertical rhythm between direct children, including escaped blocks and embedded playground/codeblock roots
- Added prose CSS contract coverage to prevent regressions in exclude behavior and block-spacing flow.
- Documented the prose escape hatch and auto-excluded component roots in the visual baseline docs.

## 1.18.1

### Fixed

- Refined `VfMenuBar` popup positioning after horizontal-scroller integration:
  - stabilized root submenu teleport overlay behavior in constrained containers
  - fixed nested submenu rendering/placement regressions caused by mixed positioning contexts
  - improved submenu interaction consistency for hover/click branch navigation
- Improved `VfTabs`/`VfMenuBar` shared horizontal-scroller behavior and related navigation styles for more stable overflow UX.

## 1.18.0

### Changed

- Expanded and normalized theme token coverage with reusable size primitives (`iconSizeSm`/`Md`/`Lg`/`Xl`) and broader token-to-token mappings across navigation, overlays, tables, badges, tags, and tooltip sizing.
- Refined default light/dark semantic palette values (`primary`, `info`, `warn`, `help`, `success`) and focus/overlay color mixing for more consistent contrast behavior.
- Updated component style internals to consume normalized token aliases in actions, navigation, overlays, surfaces, and feedback layers.
- Tuned menu and nav item spacing/padding defaults and top-level menu-bar item inline padding for denser, more consistent rhythm.
- Aligned typography defaults for `headingH6` and prose inline code to shared token scales.

## 1.17.7

### Changed

- Removed `size` support from `VfTabs` (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) and aligned the component to a single size behavior.
- Removed automatic `scrollIntoView` call from `VfTabs` indicator sync to prevent page-level scroll jumps during page refresh and initial render.
- Updated `VfTabs` overflow behavior so long tab lists scroll horizontally inside component bounds instead of stretching adjacent layout.
- Improved `VfTabs` active-indicator behavior during horizontal scroll:
  - keeps indicator position synced with scrolled content
  - clips indicator width to the visible viewport
  - hides indicator when active tab is fully out of view
  - disables transition while scrolling to avoid lagging "floating" motion
- Added dynamic scroll-edge hints for `VfTabs` that appear only when content is actually hidden on the left or right side.
- Added side scroll buttons for `VfTabs` that appear only when tab content is clipped and allow quick left/right navigation.
- Added/updated `VfTabs` theme tokens for scroll controls, backgrounds, focus ring, fade overlays, and disabled tab color.
- Updated `VfTabs` showcase examples to remove size variants and reflect the current single-size API.
- Added regression coverage for overflow scroll controls and removed obsolete size-prop coverage.

## 1.17.6

- Updated `VfTabs` overflow behavior so long tab lists scroll horizontally inside component bounds instead of stretching adjacent layout.
- Improved `VfTabs` active-indicator behavior during horizontal scroll:
  - keeps indicator position synced with scrolled content
  - clips indicator width to the visible viewport
  - hides indicator when active tab is fully out of view
  - disables transition while scrolling to avoid lagging "floating" motion
- Added dynamic scroll-edge hints for `VfTabs` that appear only when content is actually hidden on the left or right side.
- Expanded `VfTabs` showcase examples to demonstrate all supported sizes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) with overflow scenarios.
- Added regression coverage for `VfTabs` size class application.

## 1.17.5

### Changed

- Updated `VfTabs` so the `tabpanel` block is rendered only when the `panel` slot is provided, allowing use as a standalone tab switcher without empty content containers.
- Added regression coverage to ensure `VfTabs` does not render `role="tabpanel"` when no `panel` slot is passed.

## 1.17.4

### Changed

- Refined `vf-prose` inline code styling so code snippets remain recognizable while aligning better with surrounding prose text.
- Aligned `vf-prose` inline and block code treatments with shared mono sizing, text color, radius, and muted color-mix backgrounds.
- Updated prose code tokens so inline code uses a fixed `0.875rem` font size with balanced padding.

## 1.17.3

### Changed

- Reworked `vf-prose` vertical rhythm rules to make top-level spacing predictable across semantic content combinations (`headings`, `paragraphs`, `lists`, `blockquotes`, `code blocks`, and `hr`).
- Resolved multiple prose spacing regressions caused by selector ordering and margin resets, ensuring intended spacing rules are not overridden by list/blockquote reset styles.
- Added explicit `vf-prose hr` styling based on theme border tokens so separators remain visually consistent in both light and dark themes.
- Added `proseHrBorderWidth` and `proseHrOpacity` theme tokens for prose separator customization.
- Refined `vf-prose` blockquote layout by removing vertical inner padding to align visual rhythm with surrounding prose blocks.
- Expanded `vf-prose` demo coverage with a spacing matrix that exercises common block-to-block transitions for easier visual QA.
- Updated dependency range for `@codemonster-ru/floater.js` to `^1.0.8`.

## 1.17.2

### Changed

- Updated navigation and table-of-contents token references from `level0` to `level-0` CSS variable names, restoring nested indentation for `VfNavMenu` simple variants after the serializer update.
- Updated heading utility/prose token references from `--vf-heading-h1-*` … `--vf-heading-h6-*` to `--vf-heading-h-1-*` … `--vf-heading-h-6-*` to match generated token names.
- Replaced stale `--vf-radius-sm` references in form clear buttons with `--vf-radius-control-tight`.

## 1.17.1

### Changed

- Updated `@codemonster-ru/vueforge-theme` to `^1.2.2`, which fixes CSS variable serialization for numeric token suffixes (for example, `breakpoint2xl` now serializes to `--vf-breakpoint-2xl`).
- Added regression coverage in the theme bridge tests to keep `--vf-breakpoint-2xl` serialization stable.

## 1.17.0

### Added

  - improved matched-text highlighting behavior for title vs breadcrumb/snippet
  - right-side enter icon visibility aligned with active/hover state
- Aligned `vf-input` and `vf-select` demo blocks to the same example order and coverage.
- Improved select clear/trailing icon layout to avoid right-side icon overlap.

## 1.16.3

### Added

- Added `VfDrawer` fullscreen sizing via `size="full"` and exported `VfDrawerSize` in the public type API.

### Changed

- Added fullscreen drawer layout styles for all drawer placements (`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`) so full-screen mode behaves consistently regardless of direction.
- Improved overlay scroll locking by compensating `document.body` right padding for scrollbar width while locked, preventing layout shift on open/close.
- Expanded drawer demo coverage with separate regular and fullscreen examples, including a fullscreen drawer example that opens from the left.

## 1.16.2

### Changed

- Added shared `selectableColor` token and aligned default inactive item/link colors in navigation-style components (`VfDropdown`, `VfBreadcrumbs`, `VfTabs`, `VfAccordion`, `VfNavMenu`, `VfMenuBar`, `VfTableOfContents`) to use it, while active states stay on `primary` via `--vf-selectable-active-color`.
- Added dedicated `VfSelect` option tokens (`selectOption*`) that default to the shared selectable token family, so select option colors can be overridden independently from dropdown menus.
- Increased default contrast for `VfNavMenu` group labels by setting `navMenuGroupLabelColor` to `--vf-color-text` instead of a muted mix.
- Added `menuBarTopItemFontWeight` token and applied it to top-level `VfMenuBar` items so the whole first level can be consistently emphasized without mixing weights item-by-item.
- Added `navMenuTopItemFontWeight` token and applied it to top-level `VfNavMenu` items so root-level branch and leaf items share the same weight.
- Fixed `VfNavMenu` collapse-close motion in `pills` variant by moving collapse spacing from `margin-top` to `padding-top`, removing the end-of-animation snap.
- Refined the same `VfNavMenu` collapse fix by applying top spacing to the nested list inside the collapse container (instead of the animated container itself), eliminating residual close snap.
- Set default `alertBodyColor` to `--vf-color-muted` for more consistent secondary-content tone.
- Added `selectOptionDisabledColor` token and explicit disabled-option styling for `VfSelect` menu items.

## 1.16.1

### Changed

- Refined `VfNavMenu` and `VfTableOfContents` nesting tokens to use the generated `level0` variable names consistently, restoring expected nested indentation.
- Restored filled active state for `VfTableOfContents` in `pills` variant by wiring `tableOfContentsPillsActiveBackground` to `--vf-selectable-active-background`.
- Updated `VfDropdown` hover selectors so active items keep their active background on hover in both `default` and `pills` variants.
- Rebalanced heading scale:
  - `h1` reduced to `30px`
  - `h2–h6` scaled down proportionally and rounded to whole-pixel values (`26px`, `23px`, `19px`, `17px`, `14px`)
- Updated `vf-prose` color hierarchy:
  - body text now uses muted tone
  - headings use contrast tone
  - dark theme headings are rendered white

  - content utilities (`vf-list-*`, `vf-blockquote`, `vf-prose`, `vf-sr-only`, truncation and wrapping helpers)
- Added dedicated theme tokens for typography/content utilities so heading, link, code, list, blockquote, and prose rhythm can be customized via tokens.
- Expanded demo coverage with a dedicated Typography section and examples for all new utilities.

### Changed

- Switched theme token injection to a single runtime source via plugin application (removed static token/theme CSS side-effect imports from package entry).
- Moved base color-scheme/form-font defaults into component base styles so default behavior remains stable with single-source theme injection.
- Added TypeScript module declaration support for side-effect CSS imports (`declare module "*.css"`).
